title: "Writer AI module"
---

This module leverages the [Writer Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/writer-sdk/) to enable applications to interact with large language models (LLMs) in chat or text completion formats. It provides tools to manage conversation states and to dynamically interact with LLMs using both synchronous and asynchronous methods.

## Getting your API key
To utilize the Writer AI module, you'll need to configure the `WRITER_API_KEY` environment variable with an API key obtained from AI Studio. Here is a detailed [guide](/api-guides/quickstart) to setup up this key. You will need to select an **API** app under **Developer tools**

Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable on your system:
<CodeGroup>
 ``` bash For macOS and Linux
export WRITER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
 ```
```bash For Windows
set WRITER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
</CodeGroup>
You can manage your environment variables using methods that best suit your setup, such as employing tools like [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

Furthermore, when deploying an application with `writer deploy`, the `WRITER_API_KEY` environment variable is automatically configured with the API key specified during the deployment process.

## Chat completion with the Conversation class
The `Conversation` class manages LLM communications within a chat framework, storing the conversation history and handling the interactions.

```python
import writer as wf
import writer.ai

def handle_simple_message(state, payload):
    # Update the conversation state by appending the incoming user message.
    state["conversation"] += payload
    
    # Stream the complete response from the AI model in chunks.
    for chunk in state["conversation"].stream_complete():
        # Append each chunk of the model's response to the ongoing conversation state.
        state["conversation"] += chunk

# Initialize the application state with a new Conversation object.
initial_state = wf.init_state({
    "conversation": writer.ai.Conversation(),
})
```

### Initializing a conversation
A `Conversation` can be initialized with either a system prompt or a list of previous messages. It can also accept a default configuration dictionary that sets parameters for all interactions.


```python
# Initialize with a system prompt for a Financial Analyst specializing in balance sheets
conversation = Conversation("You assist clients with analyzing and understanding their balance sheets")

# Initialize with a history of messages related to balance sheet queries
history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the liabilities section?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Liabilities are legally binding obligations payable to another entity."}
]

conversation = Conversation(history)

# Initialize with a configuration suitable for financial analysis discussions
config = {'max_tokens': 200, 'temperature': 0.5}
conversation = Conversation("You provide detailed insights into balance sheet components", config=config)
```

### Adding messages to conversation
Messages can be added to a `Conversation` instance using the `+` operator or the `add` method.

```python
# Using the `+` operator to add a balance sheet-related query
conversation += {"role": "user", "content": "Can you break down the assets section of the balance sheet?"}

# Using the `add` method to add a balance sheet-related query
conversation.add(role="user", content="How should I interpret the equity section?")
```

### Completing and streaming Conversations
The `complete` and `stream_complete` methods facilitate interaction with the LLM based on the accumulated messages and configuration. These methods execute calls to generate responses and return them in the form of a message object, but do not alter the conversation's `messages` list, allowing you to validate or modify the output before deciding to add it to the history.

<CodeGroup>
```python complete
# Using `complete` to get a single response
response = conversation.complete()
print("LLM Response:", response)
```
``` python stream_complete
# Using `stream_complete` to get streamed responses
for chunk in conversation.stream_complete():
    print("Streamed Message:", chunk)
    # Manually adding to the conversation
    conversation += chunk
```
</CodeGroup>

Instance-wide configuration parameters can be complemented or overriden on individual call's level, if a `config` dictionary is provided to the method:

```python
# Overriding configuration for a specific call
response = conversation.complete(config={'max_tokens': 200, 'temperature': 0.5})
```

### Using Graphs with Conversation
A `Graph` is a collection of files meant to provide their contents to the LLM during conversations. Framework allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete graphs, as well as manage the files within them.

#### Creating and Managing Graphs

To create and manipulate graphs, use the following methods:
```python
from writer.ai import create_graph, retrieve_graph, list_graphs, delete_graph

# Create a new graph
graph = create_graph(name="Financial Data", description="Quarterly reports")

# Retrieve an existing graph by ID
graph = retrieve_graph("d90a632b-5c1f-42b8-8748-5b7f769d9a36")

# Update a graph
graph.update(name="Updated Financial Data", description="Updated description")

# Retrieve a list of created graphs
graphs = list_graphs()
for graph in graphs:
    # Delete a graph
    delete_graph(graph)
```

#### Adding and Removing Files from Graphs

You can upload files, associate them with graphs, and download or remove them.
```python
from writer.ai import upload_file

# Upload a file
file = upload_file(data=b"file content", type="application/pdf", name="Report.pdf")

# Add the file to a graph
graph.add_file(file)

# Remove the file from the graph
graph.remove_file(file)
````

#### Applying Graphs to Conversation completion

You can utilize graphs within conversations. For instance, you may want to provide the LLM access to a collection of files during an ongoing conversation to query or analyze the file content. When passing a graph to the conversation, the LLM can query the graph to retrieve relevant data.

```python
# Retrieve a graph
graph = retrieve_graph("d90a632b-5c1f-42b8-8748-5b7f769d9a36")

# Pass the graph to the conversation for completion
response = conversation.complete(tools=graph)
```

Alternatively, you can define a graph using JSON:

```python
tool = {
    "type": "graph",
    "graph_ids": ["d90a632b-5c1f-42b8-8748-5b7f769d9a36"]
}

response = conversation.complete(tools=tool)
```

### Using Function Calls with Conversations
<Warning> 
Function tools are only available with `palmyra-x-004` model
</Warning> 
Framework allows you to register Python functions that can be called automatically during conversations. When the LLM determines a need for specific information or processing, it issues a request to use the local code (your function), and Framework handles that request automatically.

#### Defining Function Tools

Function tools are defined using either a Python class or a JSON configuration.
```python
from writer.ai import create_function_tool

# Define a function tool with Python callable
def calculate_interest(principal: float, rate: float, time: float):
    return principal * rate * time

tool = create_function_tool(
    name="calculate_interest",
    callable=calculate_interest,
    parameters={
        "principal": {"type": "float", "description": "Loan principal"},
        "rate": {"type": "float", "description": "Interest rate"},
        "time": {"type": "float", "description": "Time in years"}
    }
)

response = conversation.complete(tools=tool)
```

Alternatively, you can define a function tool in JSON format, but the callable function must still be passed:
```python
tool = {
    "type": "function",
    "name": "calculate_interest",
    "callable": calculate_interest,
    "parameters": {
        "principal": {"type": "float", "description": "Loan principal"},
        "rate": {"type": "float", "description": "Interest rate"},
        "time": {"type": "float", "description": "Time in years"}
    }
}

response = conversation.complete(tools=tool)
```
Function tools require the following properties:
- **`name: str`**: A string that defines how the function is referenced by the LLM. It should describe the function’s purpose. 
- **`callable: Callable`**: A Python function that will be called automatically when needed by the LLM.  
- **`parameters: dict`**: A dictionary that specifies what input the function expects. The keys should match the function’s parameter names, and each parameter should have a `type`, and an optional `description`.  
    Supported types are: `string`, `number`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `array`, `object` and `null`.

#### Automated Function Calling

When a conversation involves a tool (either a graph or a function), Framework automatically handles the requests from LLM to use the tools during interactions. If the tool needs multiple steps (for example, querying data and processing it), Framework will handle those steps recursively, calling functions as needed until the final result is returned.

By default, to prevent endless recursion, Framework will only handle 3 consecutive tool calls. You can expand it in case it doesn't suit your case – both `complete()` and `stream_complete()` accept a `max_tool_depth` parameter, which configures the maximum allowed recursion depth:

```python
response = conversation.complete(tools=tool, max_tool_depth=7)
```

### Providing a Tool or a List of Tools

You can pass either a single tool or a list of tools to the `complete()` or `stream_complete()` methods. The tools can be a combination of FunctionTool, Graph, or JSON-defined tools.

```python
from writer.ai import FunctionTool, retrieve_graph

# Define a function tool
tool1 = FunctionTool(
    name="get_data",
    callable=lambda x: f"Data for {x}",
    parameters={"x": {"type": "string", "description": "Input value"}}
)

# Retrieve a graph
graph = retrieve_graph("d90a632b-5c1f-42b8-8748-5b7f769d9a36")

# Provide both tools in a list
response = conversation.complete(tools=[tool1, graph])
```

## Text generation without a conversation state
These `complete` and `stream_complete` methods are designed for one-off text generation without the need to manage a conversation state. They return the model's response as a string. Each function accepts a `config` dictionary allowing call-specific configurations.

<CodeGroup>
```python complete
# Using `complete` for a single completion
text_response = complete("Explore the benefits of AI.", config={'temperature': 0.3})
print("Completion:", text_response)
```
```python stream_complete
# Using `stream_complete` for streamed text completions
for text_chunk in stream_complete("Explore the benefits of AI.", config={'temperature': 0.3}):
    print("Streamed Text:", text_chunk)
```
</CodeGroup>
