title: "Social post generator"
---

In this tutorial, you'll create a social post generator using the Writer Framework.

You'll build an AI-powered tool for generating social media posts and tags based on the input you provide! You'll do this in minutes using a drag-and-drop visual editor to build the user interface and Python for the back-end code.

Here's what the finished project will look like:

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **A Writer account:** Create a free account at [writer.com](https://writer.com).
- **Python 3.7+**: Use the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip:** This command-line application comes with Python and is used for installing Python packages, including those from Writer.
- **A basic understanding of Python:** You should be familiar with the basics of the language.
- **Your favorite code editor (optional):** There's a code editor built into Writer for writing back-end code, but you can also use Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, or any text editor made for programming if you prefer.


## Setting up your project

### Create a Writer app and get its API key

First, you'll need to create a new app within Writer. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the app in Writer">
  Log into Writer. From the Home screen, click on the **Build an app** button.

  ![Writer home screen](/framework/images/tutorial/social_post/sp_gen_2.png)

  The **Start building** menu will appear, presenting options for the types of apps you can create.

  Select **Framework**, located under **Developer tools**. This will create a brand new app based on Writer Framework.

  !["Start building" menu](/framework/images/tutorial/social_post/sp_gen_3.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your app's API key">
  On the next screen, titled **How to deploy an application**, you can get the API key for the app by clicking on the **Reveal key** button, located under the text **Authenticate with an API key**. Your complete API key will be displayed, and a "copy" button will appear, enabling you to copy the key.

  !["How to deploy an application" page](/framework/images/tutorial/social_post/sp_gen_2a.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Set up your computer and create the app's project

The next step is to set up the Writer Framework environment on your computer. You'll do this by creating a directory for the project, installing dependencies, and creating the project for the application using a template.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your terminal application">
  Open your terminal application. On macOS and Linux, this application goes by the name _Terminal_; on Windows, you can use either _Windows PowerShell_ or _Command Prompt_.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the dependencies">
  <Note>If you already have the `writer` and `python-dotenv` packages installed on your computer, you can skip this step.</Note>

  Install the `writer` and `python-dotenv` packages by entering the following commands in your terminal application:

  ```
  pip install writer python-dotenv
  ```

  This command tells `pip`, the Python package installer, to install two packages:

  - `writer`, which provides some command-line commands and enables Python code to interact with Writer and the Writer Framework.
  - `python-dotenv`, which makes it easy to manage environment variables by loading them from a `.env` file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the project directory">
  Enter the following commands into your terminal application:

  ```
  mkdir social-post-generator
  cd social-post-generator
  ```

  These commands will create a new directory named `social-post-generator` (the directory for your project) and put you in that directory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a .env file">
  Using your code editor, create a new file and enter the following into it, `[your_api_key]` with the API key you copied earlier:

  ```
  WRITER_API_KEY=[your_api_key]
  ```
  
  Save the file with the name `.env` in your project directory. Its name is short for "environment," and it's where the application will get the values for its environment variables.

  <Note>On macOS, you might be presented with a pop-up asking **Are you sure you want to use a name that begins with a period "."? — you do, so select the **Use "."** button.</Note>

  The chat assistant app will read the API key from this file and use it to access the Writer Framework. Don't forget to save the file!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the project">
  Go back to your terminal application and create the project by entering this command:

  ```
  writer create social-post-generator --template=ai-starter
  ```
  
  This command sets up a new project called `social-post-generator` using a starter template called `ai-starter` so that you're not starting "from scratch."
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Build the UI

Now that you've created the project, it's time to define the UI. The Writer Framework's drag-and-drop capabilities make it easy — even if you haven't done much UI work before!

The project editor is a web application that runs on your computer and enables you to define and edit your app's user interface. Launch it by typing the following into your terminal application:

```
writer edit social-post-generator
```

You'll be presented with the URL for the project editor. Control-click the link (Command-click on macOS) to open the project editor, or copy the URL and paste it into the address bar of a browser window.

You'll be presented with the project editor:

![Project editor](/framework/images/tutorial/social_post/sp_gen_2b.png)

You'll see the following: 

- The **canvas** is in the center. It displays the app's user interface. 
- The column on the left contains:
  - The **Toolkit**, which contains all the UI components. You define the user interface by dragging components from the Toolkit and placing them on the canvas.
  - The **Component tree**, which shows the arrangement of the UI components on the canvas. It's also useful for selecting items on the canvas, especially when it has a lot of UI components.

It's time to build the UI!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Examine the header">
  Select the **Header** component by clicking it — it's the component at the top, containing the title **AI STARTER** and a gray area labeled **Empty Header**.

  When you click it, you'll see the **Properties** panel appear on the right side of the page. This lets you view and edit the properties of the selected component.

  The first property you'll see in the panel is the **Text** property, which defines the text that appears as the header's title. It should contain the value `@{my_app.title}`. The `@{` and `}` indicate that `my_app.title` is a variable and that its contents should be the text displayed instead of the literal text "my_app.title". You'll set the value of this variable soon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clear the Section's default title">
  Select the **Section** component by clicking it — it's just below the **Header** component and contains the title **Section Title** and a gray area labeled **Empty Section**.

  In the **Properties** panel, clear out the value of the **Title** property. This will remove the _Section_'s default title.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Text Input component">
  The user will need a place to enter words or phrases that the app will use as the basis for generating posts and tags.
  
  Drag a **Text Input** component from the **Toolkit** panel on the left (it's under **Input**, and you may need to scroll down a little to find it) and into the **Section**. Sections can act as containers for other components.

  Select the **Text Input** component. In the **Properties** panel:

  - Find the **Label** property and set its value to `Topic for social posts and tags`.
  - (Optional) Feel free to add some placeholder to the *Text Input* component by setting the value of the **Placeholder** property with something like `Enter words or phrases describing your topic`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Button component">
  Drag a **Button** component from the **Toolkit** panel (it's under **Other**, and you may need to scroll down a little to find it) into the **Section**, directly below the **Text Input**. The user will click this button to submit their prompt.

  Select the **Button**. In the **Properties** panel:

  - Set the **Text** property's value to `Generate posts`.  
  - Find the **Icon** property, and set its value to `arrow_forward`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Message component">
  The process of creating social media posts and tags takes a few moments. In order to reassure the user that the app is working and hasn't crashed, it will use a **Message** component to display something reassuring while it's generating. 

  Drag a **Message** component from the **Toolkit** panel into the **Section** positioning it immediately below the **Button**.

  Select the **Message** component. In the **Properties** panel:

  - Scroll down to the **Style** section and look for the **Loading** property, which sets the color of the **Message** component when it's loading.
  - Click its **Pick** button, which will cause a color strip to appear.
  - Click the color strip to enter the following values:
      - **R**: 212
      - **G**: 255
      - **B**: 242
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new Section">
  The **Section** that you were working on is for user input. Let's add a new **Section** to hold the output — the social media posts and tags the app will generate.

  Drag a **Section** component from the **Toolbox** panel and place it _inside_ the **Section** that's already there, just below the **Message** component.

  <Note>That's right — **Sections** can contain other **Sections**!</Note>

  Select the **Section** you just added. In the **Properties** panel:

  - Find the **Title** property and clear it its value to remove the **Section**'s title.
  - Scroll down to the **Style** section and look for the **Container background** property, which sets the **Section**'s background color. 
  - Click its **Pick** button, which will cause a color strip to appear.
  - Click the color strip to enter the following values:
      - **R**: 246
      - **G**: 239
      - **B**: 253
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Tags component">
  Writer Framework has a number of useful components to make your apps more functional and beautiful. One of these is the **Tags** component, which can take a list of hashtags (or words, or short phrases) and display them inside colorful "bubbles" to make them stand out. This app will display the social media tags it generates in a **Tags** component.

  Drag a **Tags** component from the **Toolbox** panel and place it inside the new **Section**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Separator">
  Drag a **Separator** component from the **Toolbox** panel and place it inside the new **Section**, just below the **Tags** component. This will separate the tags from the posts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Text component">
  Finally, drag a **Text** component from the **Toolbox** panel and position it below the **Separator**. This will hold the generated social media posts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The project editor should now look like this:

![Project editor with components laid out](/framework/images/tutorial/social_post/sp_gen_2c.png)


## Add the back-end code

With the UI laid out, it's time to work on the logic behind it. 

Switch to your code editor and open the `main.py` file in your project's directory. This file was automatically generated; you'll update the code in it to define the behavior of your app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import libraries and load the Writer Framework API key">
  You should see the following at the start of the file:

  ```python
  import writer as wf
  import writer.ai
  ```

  Replace that code with the following:

  ```python
  import os
  import re
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  import writer as wf
  import writer.ai

  # Load environment variables from .env file
  load_dotenv()

  # Set the API key
  wf.api_key = os.getenv("WRITER_API_KEY")
  ```
  
  This code imports the libraries that the application will need and then reads your Writer Framework API key from the `.env` file in your project's directory.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the application">
  The next step is to set the application's initial state. Find this code...

  ```python
  # Welcome to Writer Framework! 
  # This template is a starting point for your AI apps.
  # More documentation is available at https://dev.writer.com/framework


  # Initialise the state
  wf.init_state({
      "my_app": {
          "title": "AI STARTER"
      },
  })
  ```

  ...and replace it with the following:

  ```python
  # Initialize the state
  wf.init_state({
      "topic": "writing",
      "message": "",
      "tags": {},
      "posts": "",
      "my_app": {
          "title": "SOCIAL POST GENERATOR"
      }
  })
  ```

  The Writer Framework's `init_state()` method sets the initial value of `state`, a dictionary containing values that define the state of the application. The key-value pairs in `state` are how you store values used by your app and how you pass data between the back-end code and the UI.

  The code above sets the initial value of `state` so that it has these key-value pairs:

  - `topic`: A string containing the topic that the application should generate social media posts and tags for. You'll bind its value to the _Text Input_ component where the user will enter the topic.
  - `message`: A string containing text of the message that will be displayed to the user while the application is generating posts and tags. You'll bind its value to the **Message** component.
  - `tags`: A list containing the hashtags generated by the LLM. You'll bind its value to the **Tags** component.
  - `posts`: A string containing the social media posts generated by the LLM. You'll bind its value to the **Text** component.
  - `my_app`: A dictionary containing values that define the application's appearance. This dictionary has a single key-value pair, `title`, which defines the text that appears as the application's title.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a handler to respond to the user's input">
  When the user presses the app's **Button**, the app needs to call a function to generate and display the social media posts and tags. Add the following to the end of `main.py`:

  ```python
  def generate_and_display_posts_and_tags(state):
      # Display message
      state["message"] = "% Generating social media posts and tags for you..."

      # Generate and display social posts
      prompt = f"You are a social media expert. Generate 5 engaging social media posts about {state['topic']}. Include emojis, and put a blank line between each post."
      state["posts"] = writer.ai.complete(prompt)

      # Generate and display hashtags
      prompt = f"You are a social media expert. Generate around 5 hashtags about {state['topic']}, delimited by spaces. For example, #dogs #cats #ducks #elephants #badgers"
      pattern = r"#\w+"
      hashtags = re.findall(pattern, writer.ai.complete(prompt))
      state["tags"] = {item: item for item in hashtags}

      # Hide message
      state["message"] = ""
  ```

  Some notes about this function:

  - The `%` at the start of the string being assigned to `state["message"]` will be replaced by a “spinning circle” progress indicator graphic in the _Message_ component.
  - The `pattern` variable in the `# Generate and display hashtags` section defines a regular expression pattern to search for words that begin with the `#` character. The `r` in front of the opening quote specifies that the string is a _raw string_, which means that the `\` character should be treated as a literal backslash and not as the start of an escape character sequence. 
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Bind the UI to the back-end code

You've built the UI and written the code behind it. Let's connect the two! Go back to the browser window with the project editor and do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observe that the heading at the top of the app is now 'SOCIAL POST GENERATOR'">
  Earlier, you saw that the **Header** component's **Text** property was set to `@{my_app.title}`, a value in the app's `state` variable. You changed this value when you update the call to the Writer Framework's `init_state()` method.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bind the Text Input component to the 'state' variable's 'topic' key">
  Select the **Text Input** component. In the **Properties** panel, scroll down to the **Binding** section and find the **State element** property. This is where you specify the `state` variable key whose value will be connected to the **Text Input** component. Set its value to `topic`.    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Button component to the 'generate_and_display_posts_and_tags()' function">
  Select the **Button** component. In the **Properties** panel, scroll down to the **Events** section and find the **`wf-click`** property. This is where you specify the function to call when the user clicks the button — set its value to `generate_and_display_posts_and_tags`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bind the Message component to the 'state' variable's 'message' key">
  Select the **Message** component. In the **Properties** panel, find the **Message** property, which specifies the content of the **Message** component. Set its value to `@{message}`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bind the Tags component to the 'state' variable's 'tags' key.">
  Select the **Tags** component. In the **Properties** panel:
  
  - Find the **Tags** property, which specifies the source of the tags that the component will display.
  - Click its **JSON** button.
  - In the text field below the **JSON** button, set the **Tags** property's value to `@{tags}`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bind the Text component to the 'state' variable's 'posts' key">
  Select the **Text** component. In the **Properties** panel:
  
  - Find the **Text** property, which specifies the content of the **Text** component. Set its value to `@{posts}`.
  - Set the **Use Markdown** property to **yes**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the visiblity of the Section component containing the Tags and Text components based on the 'state' variable's 'posts' key">
  Select the **Section** component containing the **Tags** and **Text** components. In the **Properties** panel:

  - Scroll to the **Visibility** property at the bottom.
  - Click on the **Custom** button.
  - In the **Visibility value** field, set the value to `posts`. This will cause the **Section** to be visible only when the `state` variable's `posts` key has a non-empty value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Run the application locally

The application is ready to run locally!

Switch back your terminal application. Stop the editor with ctrl-c, then run the application by entering the following command in your project directory:

```
writer run social-post-generator
```

This will start the application, which you can access with your browser at the URL that appears on the command line.

<Note>The Writer editor, which you launched with `writer edit social-post-generator`, and your application, which you launched with `writer run social-post-generator`, run  on the same URL, but on different *ports* (specified by the number after the `:` character at the end of the URL).</Note>


## Deploy the app to the Writer Cloud (optional)

Right now, the app will only run on your computer. To make it available online, you'll need to deploy it to the Writer Cloud.

In your terminal application, stop your app with ctrl-c, then deploy your application by entering the following command:

```
writer deploy social-post-generator
```

You'll be asked to enter your app's API key. Once you do that, the Writer command-line application will start deploying your application to the Writer Cloud. The process should take a couple of minutes.

Once the app has been deployed to the Writer Cloud, you'll be shown the URL for your application, which you can use to access it online.


## Conclusion

That's it — you've built a functional social post generator using the Writer Framework! 

Feel free to modify this project! The Writer platform is flexible enough for you to customize, extend, and evolve your application into something completely different! To find out what else you can do, check out the documentation for [Writer Framework](https://dev.writer.com/framework/introduction) and the [Writer API](https://dev.writer.com/api-guides/introduction).
